# 🏃‍♂️ Sonic Themed Infinite Game Runner

Live demo : https://abhyudaya764.itch.io/sonic-dash

This is a **Sonic-inspired game** built using the **Kaplay.js** library. The game features smooth character movement, obstacle interactions, and a dynamic UI. Everything is implemented in JavaScript, without any game engine like Unity.

## 🎮 Features & Implementation

### 🔹 **Character Movement**
I scripted Sonic’s movement using **Kaplay.js**, handling acceleration, deceleration, and jump mechanics with **custom physics calculations**.

### 🔹 **Obstacle & Collision Detection**
Using **Kaplay.js physics engine**, I implemented **bounding box collision detection** to handle interactions with enemies, spikes, and platforms dynamically.

### 🔹 **Ring Collection System**
I created a **ring counter system** that tracks collected rings. When Sonic collides with an enemy, a portion of rings is lost, updating the UI dynamically.

### 🔹 **Game State Management**
Game progress is managed with **JavaScript event listeners and state tracking**, allowing for level resets when Sonic loses lives.

### 🔹 **UI & Sound Effects**
The UI includes a **ring counter, timer, and game-over screen**, all dynamically updated using JavaScript. I integrated **audio effects** for jumping, collecting rings, and taking damage to enhance the experience.

## 🚀 Deploying to Itch.io

The game is **WebGL-compatible** and runs directly in a browser.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Kaplay.js** – JavaScript game library
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Game logic & mechanics
- **HTML & CSS** – UI and layout
- **Canvas API** – Rendering game objects
- **Itch.io** – Web hosting

## 📢 About the Project
I built this project to explore **Kaplay.js for game development**, handling game physics, UI updates, and browser-based deployment without a game engine. This approach provides greater flexibility and control over performance.
